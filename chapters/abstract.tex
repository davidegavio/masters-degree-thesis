A semantic approach based on Machine Learning Algorithms is proposed to enhance document indexing capability to deal with knowledge management problem in big organizations.
While the technological challenges (i.e., being able to collect and store all these sources in a single point), could be - more or less - easily addressed using indexing technologies such as Apache Lucene and/or cloud-based X-As-A-Service services, the automatic extraction of semantic representation on a given document is still an open point.
This work implements a practical solution to surface facts and knowledge via typed Natural Language Processing extending a domain specific index (e.g., knowledge graphs, ontologies, taxonomies, ...), using cutting edge frameworks and technologies such as TensorFlow, Apache Spark, Lucene, Kibana.
This work will constitute an architectural module that will be further specialised to cope with different domains and/or knowledge systems.
