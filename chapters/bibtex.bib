abstract = {Often the best performing supervised learning models are ensembles of hundreds or
thousands of base-level classifiers. Unfortunately, the space required to store this
many classifiers, and the time required to execute them at run-time, prohibits their
use in applications where test sets are large (e.g. Google), where storage space is
at a premium (e.g. PDAs), and where computational power is limited (e.g. hea-ring
aids). We present a method for "compressing" large, complex ensembles into smaller,
faster models, usually without significant loss in performance.},

	journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
	abstract = {String-based similarity metrics were mainly used to lexically measure the similarity between words based on the string sequences and character compositions. This research aimed to build an application that can identify the similarity between documents. The program employed two lexical-based algorithms, N-gram and Jaccard, to check the documents similarity. The author focused on analysing the algorithms’ performance based on accuracy, sensitivity, and efficiency metric. Datasets used in this research were the final thesis documents in Indonesian and English language. Experiment results revealed that Jaccard algorithm has a better performance in term of accuracy and sensitivity compared to N-gram. Notwithstanding its superior performance, Jaccard had a longer running time than N-gram to process documents. Furthermore, the results also pointed out that the cross-language documents were indeed affecting the degree of similarity checking.}

abstract = {Spanner is Google’s scalable, multiversion, globally distributed, and synchronously
replicated database. It is the first system to distribute data at global scale and
support externally-consistent distributed transactions. This article describes how
Spanner is structured, its feature set, the rationale underlying various design decisions,
and a novel time API that exposes clock uncertainty. This API and its implementation
are critical to supporting external consistency and a variety of powerful features:
nonblocking reads in the past, lock-free snapshot transactions, and atomic schema
changes, across all of Spanner.},
